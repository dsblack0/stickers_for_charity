**Our team will be using AWS EC2 to deploy the website, since raspberry pi can only be controlled by one member and is unstable for long amounts of time**

## Hosting Plan 
### Short term (first year): 
AWS EC2 is free for the first year, so we will use this plan without having to contact sponsor for funding

### Long term: 
After the first year, our sponsor Stickers for Charity club will fund the continual deployment of their website, still using the AWS EC2 plan. Specifically, they will be paying for the Spot Instances deployment plan:
